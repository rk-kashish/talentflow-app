TalentFlow - A Mini Hiring Platform

This is a React-based front-end project for "TalentFlow," a mini hiring platform, built as a technical assignment.

It features a full-featured UI for managing jobs, candidates, and assessments, and it simulates a complete backend using Mock Service Worker (MSW) for the API and Dexie.js (IndexedDB) for persistent local storage.

Features Implemented

Jobs Board:

Create, Read, Edit, and Archive jobs.

Server-like pagination and filtering.

Drag-and-drop reordering with optimistic updates and error rollback.

Candidates Pipeline:

Paginated list view with search and filtering for 1,000+ candidates.

Drag-and-drop Kanban board (for applied to rejected stages).

Optimistic updates and error rollback on the Kanban.

Candidate profile page with a mock timeline.

Assessment Builder:

Create job-specific quizzes with various question types (text, single/multi-choice, etc.).

Live preview of the assessment form.

(Note: Assessment submission/runtime is stubbed).

Mock Backend:

MSW (Mock Service Worker): Intercepts all API calls (/api/...) to simulate a real network. Includes artificial latency and a 5-10% random error rate on write operations.

Dexie.js (IndexedDB): All data (jobs, candidates) is persisted in the browser's IndexedDB. Data survives page refreshes and is re-seeded on first load.

Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd talentflow-app

2. Install Dependencies

You must install the project dependencies, including react, vite, dexie (for the database), and msw (for the mock API).

npm install
npm install dexie msw

3. Initialize Mock Service Worker (MSW)

This is a mandatory one-time step. MSW requires a service worker file in your public directory to intercept network requests.

npx msw init public/

This command will create a public/mockServiceWorker.js file.

4. Run the Development Server

You're all set! Start the Vite development server.

npm run dev

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port Vite specifies) to see the application.
